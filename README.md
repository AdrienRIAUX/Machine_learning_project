# Machine learning project

## Introduction

This repository contains my academic projects on machine learning issues, each projects has its own folder. The code and the results are avaliable through notebooks.  
I mainly use Python to code my notebooks. Nevertheless you can find R code too, to view the result on GitLab/GitHub of the R notebooks, please use the markdown file (.md) which has the same name as the R notebook (.Rmd).

List of the project:
- Car performance project
- Diabetic retinopathy debrecen project
- Heart disease project
- Spam email detection project
- Star classification project
- Churn prediction project
- House price project (work in progress)

## ML techniques

You will find both **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning** in the different projects. Basic machine learning techniques are used to obtain results such as linear regression, decisions tree, random forest, ensemble learning, dimensionality reduction, clustering, SVM...

## Folder template

If it is a Python code:
- notebook.ipynb
- data.txt/.csv/...

If it is a R code:
- images_folder
- notebook.Rmd
- notebook.md
- data.txt/.csv/...

Since the datasets are mainly small, they are stored with the notebooks.
